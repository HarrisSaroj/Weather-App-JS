# Weather-App-JS
 A Simple Weather Application usind HTML CSS and JS
 
 A weather app can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend. HTML provides the structure of the web page, while CSS adds styling to the HTML elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity to the app.
 You'll need to integrate a weather API to fetch the weather data for a specific location. The API will provide you with a JSON object containing the weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
 
 In terms of features, a weather app can include:
 
 * Current weather conditions: Displaying the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant data for a specific location.
 * Location search: Allowing users to search for weather information by entering a city name.
 * Geolocation: Automatically detecting the user's current location and displaying the weather data accordingly.
 * Visual representations: Using icons and images to represent different weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy.
